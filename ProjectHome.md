Salesforce Single Sign On (SSO) with Delegated Authentication using Google App Engine is a example Google App Engine application that allows salesforce users to use their Google credentials to log into salesforce through Delegated Authentication using Single Sign On.

The package contains a working Java Google App Engine project that allows for Single Sign On. Once a user has logged into their Google App Engine application (with the installed code) click on the Salesforce Login link to access salesforce. (assuming salesforce has been configured correctly for Delegated Authentication).

The code can be further built on to include additional bespoke security algorithms.
